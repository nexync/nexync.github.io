    content="I am a first year PhD student at Princeton Language and Intelligence (PLI) advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/">Danqi Chen</a>. My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning. I am currently interested in language models and agents; in particular, I aim to study the downstream effects of pretraining data and methods to improve the capabilities and efficiency of reasoning models. Below are a few questions I am interested in:"

      Reasoning:

        <li>Can we make reasoning models more efficient by shifting away from a discrete token space and perform reasoning in continuous latent space? <a href="./publications/index.html#ccot">Compressed Chain of Thought</a></li>
        <li>How much better would reasoning models be if trained with process rewards rather than just outcome rewards?</li>
        <li>How can we construct environments with verifiable rewards and/or induce structure into reasoning chains to make models more capabale and efficient?</li>

        Previously, I recieved my Master's at Johns Hopkins University, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/">Benjamin Van Durme</a>. 
        My prior research interests were in mathematics and fluid dynamics. 
        I performed research in these areas during my undergraduate studies at Duke University, advised by <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Tarek.Elgindi">Tarek Elgindi</a>.
